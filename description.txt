Using React on the client side and using NestJS (and https://www.prisma.io/nestjs ) on the server
side, create a very basic CRUD application.
Database type should be Postgres.
We are interested in the tables:
   Table Books, interested in columns: Title, PublishedOn
   Table Authors, interested in columns: FirstName, LastName

    * Tables should be defined with database migrations, and initially they should be seeded with a few
records into them.
    * In the home page list the books (from the Postgres DB), and show the following fields: book's title,
book's published on date and its author's full name.
    * Clicking overbook name, should open the "book details" page from where user can edit the details
for the book.
    * Clicking over author's full name, should open the "author details" page from where user can edit the
details for the author.


The solution should be docker-sized, in a way that, we should build separate docker images for:
-the client side
-the server side
-the Postgres DB
And the docker containers should be build and run using shared docker-compose file
